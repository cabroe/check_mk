description:
 This check provides information from the ipc facilities.
 It shows the summary of the kernel shared memory status,
 semaphore status and message queue status.
  
item:
 A user definable service description for Nagios.
 That description must be unique within each host.
 Changing the description will make Nagios think that
 it is another service.

examples:
 # For now, the only possible value that could be changed 
 # is user_headers and used_space from Message Status

 # set default levels to 1000 and 1500:
 check_parameters = {
     ( {'Messages Status': {'used_headers': (1000, 1500)}}, ALL_HOSTS, [ 'IPC Messages Status' ] ),
 }

 will it find? Describe the influence of check specific
 configuration parameters to the inventory.
