description:
 The check verify the queues from a Gearman Server.                                                                                                                                                            

 It checks the values of waiting, running and worker of each queue identified.

 The check alerts WARNING/CRITICAL if the number of jobs waiting in a queue getting bigger than the thresholds defined for jobs
 or when the current workers available is lesser than the thresholds defined on worker parameters.

examples:
 # Set warning and critical levels to the workers available and/or jobs waiting of all queues
 gearman_server_jobs_default_levels = (50, 100)
 gearman_server_worker_default_levels = (1, 1)

 check_parameters = [
    # Using levels of 10 (warning) and 5 (critical) for minimum number of workers available
    ( { 'worker': (10, 5) }, ALL_HOSTS, [ 'Gearman Server localhost:4730' ] ),

    # Using levels of 1000 (warning) and 2000 (critical) for minimum number of jobs waiting
    # and levels of 10 (warning) and 5 (critical) for minimum number of workers avaliable for a specific queue
    ( { 'servicegroup_custom': (1000, 2000, 10, 5) }, [ 'HOST_1' ], [ 'Gearman Server localhost:4730' ] ),
 ]

perfdata:
 {queue_waiting}: number of jobs waiting.

 {queue_running}: number of jobs running.

 {queue_worker}: number of worker available

inventory:
  Automatically.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): A dictionary with a tuple of values for jobs and worker

                   {"jobs"} - a pair of two int values to be used as a WARN/CRIT

                   {"worker"} - a pair of two int values to be used as a MIN/MAX

                   {"queue name"} - a tuple with four values to be used as jobs waiting and workers available WARN/CRIT and MIN/MAX thresholds respectively

[configuration]
gearman_server_jobs_default_levels (int, int): Default levels for jobs waiting. Default is (10, 100)
gearman_server_worker_default_levels (int, int): Default levels for workers available. Default is (1, 1)
